# Dinner Bill Splitter

This Java program helps you split a restaurant bill among a group of people. It takes input for the number of people and the total bill amount, then calculates and prints the amount each person needs to pay.

# Code Explanation
The main functionality is divided into two functions:

takeInfo()
This function prompts the user for the number of people and the total bill amount. It then calls the calc function to perform the calculation.

calc(int NumOfPeople, double tabAmount)
This function takes the number of people and the total bill amount as parameters, calculates the amount each person needs to pay, rounds it to two decimal places, and prints the result.
